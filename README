NAME
    Data::Money::Converter - Moose Role for Data::Money Converters

DESCRIPTION
    This simple module provides a base for building currency conversion
    backends for Data::Money. You can use this module either as a basis for
    understanding the common features or as a guide for implmenting your own
    converter.

SYNOPSIS
        package MyConverter;
        use Moose;
        
    with 'Data::Money::Converter';

        sub convert {
            my ($self, $money, $code) = @_;

            # convert $money->value to $code and return a new Data::Money object
        }

        1;

METHODS
    This role requires that you implement a "convert" method. It should
    expect 2 arguments: an isntance of Data::Money and a 3-character
    currency code. It does not do any checking of the code as not all
    conversion implementations may support all codes. It is recommended that
    you consult Locale::Currency.
